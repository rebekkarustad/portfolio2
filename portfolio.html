                <h2>Square Eyes</h2>
                <p>The first project at Noroff. I was tasked to make a streaming website where you can purchase high-quality videos directly from the people who make them. The website emphasizes that you can quickly discover great collections or browse through different categories to find films.</p>

                <h2>Community Science Museum</h2>
                <p>This site was made for our first semester project. The assignment was to create a website for the museum. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent.</p>

                <h2>The Travel Blog</h2>
                <p>For the project exam, we were to create a blog site. The theme was optional, so I chose to make a travel blog. The blog was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and we were to make a call to a WordPress REST API to fetch the data used.</p>

                <h2>Home Decor</h2>
                <p>For this assignment, we were to photograph product pictures and make a website around them. I chose to make a simple home decor page. The design was the main focus of this website.</p>

                <h2>Shoe Store</h2>
                <p>For this Semester Project, the goal was to create an e-commerce website with both customer-facing and an admin section. They were both responsive, and the website was to be populated by a Strapi API supplied by Noroff. To see it correctly, download both their and my API.</p>
